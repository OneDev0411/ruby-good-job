  class Performer
    # @!attribute [r] name
    # @return [String]
    #   a meaningful name to identify the performer in logs and for debugging.

    #   e.g. +"-transactional_messages,batch_processing"+.

    # @param target [Object]
    #   An object that can perform jobs. It must respond to +method_name+ by
    #   finding and performing jobs and is usually a {Job} query,
    #   e.g. +GoodJob::Job.where(queue_name: ['queue1', 'queue2'])+.
    # @param method_name [Symbol]
    #   The name of a method on +target+ that finds and performs jobs.
    # @param name [String]
    #   A name for the performer to be used in logs and for debugging.
    # @param filter [#call]
    #   Used to determine whether the performer should be used in GoodJob's
    #   current state. GoodJob state is a +Hash+ that will be passed as the
    #   first argument to +filter+ and includes info like the current queue.
