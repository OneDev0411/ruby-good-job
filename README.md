# GoodJob

GoodJob is a multithreaded, Postgres-based, ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails.

**Inspired by [Delayed::Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) and [Que](https://github.com/que-rb/que), GoodJob is designed for maximum compatibility with Ruby on Rails, ActiveJob, and Postgres to be simple and performant for most workloads.**

- **Designed for ActiveJob.** Complete support for [async, queues, delays, priorities, timeouts, and retries](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) with near-zero configuration. 
- **Built for Rails.** Fully adopts Ruby on Rails [threading and code execution guidelines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html) with [Concurrent::Ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby). 
- **Backed by Postgres.** Relies upon Postgres integrity and session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once safety and stay within the limits of `schema.rb`.
- **For most workloads.** Targets full-stack teams, economy-minded solo developers, and applications that enqueue less than 1-million jobs/day.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'good_job'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

1. Create a database migration:
    
   ```bash
    $ bin/rails g good_job:install
    ```

    Run the migration:
    
    ```bash
    $ bin/rails db:migrate
    ```
    
1. Configure the ActiveJob adapter:
    
   ```ruby
    # config/application.rb
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = :good_job
    ```
    
    By default, using `:good_job` is equivalent to manually configuring the adapter:
    
    ```ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = GoodJob::Adapter.new(execution_mode: :inline)
   
    # config/environments/test.rb
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = GoodJob::Adapter.new(execution_mode: :inline)
   
    # config/environments/production.rb
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = GoodJob::Adapter.new(execution_mode: :external)
    ```

1. Queue your job 🎉: 
    
    ```ruby
    YourJob.set(queue: :some_queue, wait: 5.minutes, priority: 10).perform_later
    ```

1. In production, the scheduler is designed to run in its own process:
    
    ```bash
    $ bundle exec good_job
    ```
   
   Configuration options available with `help`:

   ```bash
   $ bundle exec good_job help start
   
   # Usage:
   #  good_job start
   #
   # Options:
   #   [--max-threads=N]         # Maximum number of threads to use for working jobs (default: ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.size)
   #   [--queues=queue1,queue2]  # Queues to work from. Separate multiple queues with commas (default: *)
   #   [--poll-interval=N]       # Interval between polls for available jobs in seconds (default: 1)
   ```

### Error handling, retries, and reliability

GoodJob guarantees _at-least-once_ performance of jobs. GoodJob fully supports ActiveJob's built-in functionality for error handling, retries and timeouts. 

#### Error handling

By default, if a job raises an error while it is being performed, _and it bubbles up to the GoodJob backend_, GoodJob will be immediately re-perform the job until it finishes successfully.

- `Exception`-type errors, such as a SIGINT, will always cause a job to be re-performed.
- `StandardError`-type errors, by default, will cause a job to be re-performed, though this is configurable:
   
    ```ruby
    # config/initializers/good_job.rb
    GoodJob.reperform_jobs_on_standard_error = true # => default
    ```

### Retrying jobs

ActiveJob can be configured to retry an infinite number of times, with an exponential backoff. Using ActiveJob's `retry_on` will ensure that errors do not bubble up to the GoodJob backend:

```ruby
class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base  
  retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: Float::INFINITY
  # ...
end
```

When specifying a limited number of retries, care must be taken to ensure that an error does not bubble up to the GoodJob backend because that will result in the job being re-performed:

```ruby
class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base  
  retry_on StandardError, attempts: 5 do |_job, _exception|
    # Log error, etc.
    # You must implement this block, otherwise, 
    #   Active Job will re-raise the error.
    # Do not re-raise the error, otherwise 
    #   GoodJob will immediately re-perform the job. 
  end
  # ...
end
```

GoodJob can be configured to allow omitting `retry_on`'s block argument and implicitly discard un-handled errors:

```ruby
# config/initializers/good_job.rb

# Do NOT re-perform a job if a StandardError bubbles up to the GoodJob backend
GoodJob.reperform_jobs_on_standard_error = false 
```

ActiveJob's `discard_on` functionality is supported too.

#### ActionMailer retries

Using a Mailer's `#deliver_later` will enqueue an instance of `ActionMailer::DeliveryJob` which inherits from `ActiveJob::Base` rather than your applications `ApplicationJob`. You can use an initializer to configure retries on `ActionMailer::DeliveryJob`:

```ruby
# config/initializers/good_job.rb
ActionMailer::DeliveryJob.retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: Float::INFINITY
```

#### Timeouts

Job timeouts can be configured with an `around_perform`:

```ruby
class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base  
  JobTimeoutError = Class.new(StandardError)
  
  around_perform do |_job, block|
    # Timeout jobs after 10 minutes
    Timeout.timeout(10.minutes, JobTimeoutError) do
      block.call
    end
  end
end
```

### Configuring job execution threads
    
GoodJob executes enqueued jobs using threads. There is a lot than can be said about [multithreaded behavior in Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html), but briefly:

- Each GoodJob execution thread requires its own database connection, which are automatically checked out from Rails’s connection pool. _Allowing GoodJob to schedule more threads than are available in the database connection pool can lead to timeouts and is not recommended._ 
- The maximum number of GoodJob threads can be configured, in decreasing precedence:
    1. `$ bundle exec good_job --max_threads 4`
    2. `$ GOOD_JOB_MAX_THREADS=4 bundle exec good_job`
    3. `$ RAILS_MAX_THREADS=4 bundle exec good_job`
    4. Implicitly via Rails's database connection pool size (`ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.size`)

### Executing jobs async / in-process

GoodJob is able to run "async" in the same process as the webserver (e.g. `bin/rail s`). GoodJob's async execution mode offers benefits of economy by not requiring a separate job worker process, but with the tradeoff of increased complexity. Async mode can be configured in two ways:

- Directly configure the ActiveJob adapter:

    ```ruby
    # config/environments/production.rb
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = GoodJob::Adapter.new(execution_mode: :async, max_threads: 4, poll_interval: 30)
    ```
- Or, when using `...queue_adapter = :good_job`, via environment variables:

    ```bash
    $ GOOD_JOB_EXECUTION_MODE=async GOOD_JOB_MAX_THREADS=4 GOOD_JOB_POLL_INTERVAL=30 bin/rails server
    ```
 
Depending on your application configuration, you may need to take additional steps:

- Ensure that you have enough database connections for both web and job execution threads:

    ```yaml
    # config/database.yml
    pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS", 5).to_i + ENV.fetch("GOOD_JOB_MAX_THREADS", 4).to_i %>
    ```

- When running Puma with workers (`WEB_CONCURRENCY > 0`) or another process-forking webserver, GoodJob's threadpool schedulers should be stopped before forking, restarted after fork, and cleanly shut down on exit. Stopping GoodJob's scheduler pre-fork is recommended to ensure that GoodJob does not continue executing jobs in the parent/controller process. For example, with Puma:

    ```ruby
    # config/puma.rb
  
    before_fork do
      GoodJob::Scheduler.instances.each { |s| s.shutdown }
    end
    
    on_worker_boot do
      GoodJob::Scheduler.instances.each { |s| s.restart }
    end
    
    on_worker_shutdown do
      GoodJob::Scheduler.instances.each { |s| s.shutdown }
    end
    ```
  
  GoodJob is compatible with Puma's `preload_app!` method.
  
### Migrating to GoodJob from a different ActiveJob backend

If your application is already using an ActiveJob backend, you will need to install GoodJob to enqueue and perform newly created jobs _and_ finish performing pre-existing jobs on the previous backend.

1. Enqueue newly created jobs on GoodJob either entirely by setting `ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :good_job` or progressively via individual job classes:

    ```ruby
    # jobs/specific_job.rb
    class SpecificJob < ApplicationJob
      self.queue_adapter = :good_job
      # ...
    end
    ```

1. Continue running executors for both backends. For example, on Heroku it's possible to run [two processes](https://help.heroku.com/CTFS2TJK/how-do-i-run-multiple-processes-on-a-dyno) within the same dyno:
    
   ```procfile
    # Procfile
    # ...
    worker: bundle exec que ./config/environment.rb & bundle exec good_job & wait -n
    ```

1. Once you are confident that no unperformed jobs remain in the previous ActiveJob backend, code and configuration for that backend can be completely removed.

### Monitoring and preserving worked jobs

GoodJob is fully instrumented with [`ActiveSupport::Notifications`](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html#introduction-to-instrumentation).

By default, GoodJob will delete job records after they are run, regardless of whether they succeed or not (raising a kind of `StandardError`), unless they are interrupted (raising a kind of `Exception`). 

To preserve job records for later inspection, set an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/good_job.rb
GoodJob.preserve_job_records = true
```

It is also necessary to delete these preserved jobs from the database after a certain time period:

- For example, in a Rake task:
  
    ```ruby
    GoodJob::Job.finished(1.day.ago).delete_all
    ```

- For example, using the `good_job` command-line utility:

    ```bash
    $ bundle exec good_job cleanup_preserved_jobs --before-seconds-ago=86400
    ```
